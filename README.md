# HTML5Gantt
An HTML5 Gantt Chart using WebComponents

Quick, simple, easy.

## Notes
 * Tested on Chrome 46
 * The "&lt;link rel="import" href="loader.html&gt;" won't work locally (Cross Domain Origin Problem file:/// origin cannot open other files), so to test without uploading to a webserver paste the two files together into one file, then open.
